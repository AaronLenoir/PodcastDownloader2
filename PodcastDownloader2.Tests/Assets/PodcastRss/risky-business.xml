 <title>Risky Business #436 -- Do you know your supply chain is horrible?</title>
 <link>http://risky.biz/RB436</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;On this week&#039;s show we&#039;re chatting with Fitbit security director Sasha Biskup and his colleague Marc Bown about how to build secure embedded devices from  insecure components. During the development phase of some Fitbit products, the Fitbit security team has discovered some hideous vulnerabilities that could have compromised security downstream. They&#039;ve been able to mitigate these issues, but they worry other embedded device manufacturers aren&#039;t even looking at the security implications of their suppliers&#039; mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;

 <description>&lt;p&gt;On this week&#039;s show we chat with Errata Security&#039;s Robert Graham about a ridiculous non-story that had readers in the USA convinced that Slate magazine had uncovered a covert communication channel between Donald Trump and a state-linked Russian bank. The basis of this jaw-dropping conclusion? Cherry-picked DNS query logs. We&#039;ll find out why that story was total, utter bullshit in this week&#039;s feature.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Risky Business #433 -- Mirai ain&#039;t going anywhere</title>
 <link>http://risky.biz/RB433</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;On this week&#039;s show we&#039;re taking a look at the Great DDoSSening of 2016! Yep, we&#039;ll be having a look at the attacks against Dyn, but perhaps more importantly we&#039;ll be asking the question: With a zillion perma-owned things out there able to launch some pretty serious DDoS attacks: What now? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IoT device security specialist Stephen Ridley will join us in this week&#039;s feature slot to discuss that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week&#039;s sponsor interview is a cracker. We&#039;ll be chatting with Cyalnce chief research officer Jon Miller about how the hell you&#039;re supposed to benchmark AV these days. It&#039;s actually trickier than you&#039;d think, for reasons we&#039;ll get into later. We also talk about managing false positives and hit on a few other topics in that one. Jon&#039;s ex ISS X-Force, he&#039;s been around the traps for a long time and really knows what he&#039;s talking about. That&#039;s a good interview... big thanks to Cylance for sponsoring this week&#039;s show.&lt;/p&gt;

 <link>http://risky.biz/RB432</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;On this week&#039;s show we&#039;re taking a look at the business dealings of John McAfee. Earlier today the NYSE announced the company that arranged to hire McAfee, MGT Capital, would be de-listed from the NYSE: MKT small cap exchange. This follows a class action investor lawsuit and the unearthing of a remuneration agreement between the company and McAfee that have lead some to suggest the whole company could be a pump and dump scam.&lt;/p&gt;

 <description>&lt;p&gt;On this week&#039;s show we&#039;re catching up with Mustafa Al-Bassam. He&#039;s a lovely young chap from England who was one upon a time one of the LulzSec crew. Like all the other guys in that crew he got busted, but he didn&#039;t spend any time in prison and these days he&#039;s doing really well. He&#039;s finished his undergrad, works with some blockchain technology and is about to start a PhD. He joins us this week to talk about his in depth analysis of the Shadowbrokers dump, as well as to reflect on his crimes. As you&#039;ll hear, he has some regrets.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Risky Business #427 -- Cahill law partner Brad Bondi on MedSec suit</title>
 <link>http://risky.biz/RB427</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;We have a great feature interview this week. Risky Business contributor Brian Donohue spoke with Cahill law firm partner Brad Bondi about the suit St Jude Medical has brought against MedSec and Muddy Waters over the short-sell of the medical device manufacturer&#039;s shares. That is an illuminating chat that certainly gave me an understanding of where this all could be heading, both in terms of the upcoming trial and how likely it is we&#039;ll see similar stuff in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Risky Business #420 -- What we don&#039;t know about Watergate 2.0</title>
 <link>http://risky.biz/RB420</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;On this week&#039;s show we&#039;re taking a look at the DNC leaks, but don&#039;t worry, we won&#039;t be getting bogged down in the same old angles. Instead, we&#039;re going to chat to Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai from VICE motherboard about his experience in interviewing the Guccifer 2 persona. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we&#039;ll hear from Kevin Poulsen about what these latest developments mean for Wikileaks. It&#039;s a topic you&#039;re probably sick of hearing about this week, but stick with us, we&#039;ve got some new angles, and they&#039;re relevant.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Risky Business #418 -- The rise of the crypto-Taliban</title>
 <link>http://risky.biz/RB418</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;On this week&#039;s show we&#039;re chatting with The Grugq about secure messaging. Facebook has announced it&#039;s rolling out an end-to-end encryption feature and the reaction to this wonderful announcement has been somewhat bizarre. We&#039;ll be talking to Grugq about why crypto absolutists are hating on companies that are rolling out non-default e2e features. We&#039;ll also talk about a couple of interesting case studies in which e2e encryption did absolutely nothing for the people using it.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Risky Business #417 -- PlayPen ruling to let FBI off leash?</title>
 <link>http://risky.biz/RB417</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;In this week&#039;s feature interview we&#039;re chatting with Stanford&#039;s very own Jennifer Granick about a recent ruling in a Virginia court that appears to give the FBI permission to hack into any computer it wants, sans warrant. Well that&#039;s what the headlines are screaming, anyway. But as you&#039;ll hear, it&#039;s not quite that black and white.&lt;/p&gt;
