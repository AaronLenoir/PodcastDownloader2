      <description><![CDATA[<p>John Petersen has been developing software for over 20 years. It all started when, as a staff accountant, he was asked to get involved in a system upgrade to replace an old IBM Series 1 computer (about the size of a large refrigerator!). Those first programs were written in Clipper in the summer of 1987. Since that time, tools he has used include dBase, FoxBase, Visual FoxPro, and Visual Basic.<br /> An early adopter of .NET, he then decided to go to law school. After practicing law for a few years, John realized that technology was a lot more interesting than the law. Today, John focuses on ASP.NET development and is having more fun than ever solving problems for clients.<br /> John is a Practice Director for Custom Application Development at Neudesic, a Microsoft Gold Partner and the Trusted Technology Partner in Business Innovation. A 9-time recipient of Microsoft’s Most Valuable Professional (MVP) Award, John is currently an ASP.NET/IIS MVP. John is also an ASP Insider and is the INETA Mentor for Pennsylvania and West Virginia. John is the author of several books and is a frequent contributor to Code Magazine and DevConnections Magazines.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>With over 25 years in the software industry, Matt Pietrek has had quite the interesting ride. Starting at Borland in the late 1980s during the heady days of the Microsoft/Borland “compilers wars”, he got his first, intoxicating taste of OS internals, debuggers and tools. From there he spent a decade at NuMega Technologies, working on seminal, award-winning products like BoundsChecker and SoftIce. Next was a seven year stint at Microsoft where he worked on the Visual Studio debugger & profiler teams, Red Dog (now known as Azure), and Hyper-V. He currently works at Skytap, a cloud computing company. Along the way, he wrote several books on Windows internals, as well as numerous articles and columns for magazines just as MSJ/MSDN, PC Magazine, and Byte. When not slinging Python code or groveling through logs, Matt indulges his passion for distilled spirits and cocktails. He’s got a serious, ever growing collection of rums, and writes the CocktailWonk blog about his spirited adventures: http://cocktailwonk.com</p>]]></description>

        <![CDATA[<p>Walt's enthusiasm for crafting software interfaces blossomed early.  Just a few days after discovering how to make pixels move around the screen of a borrowed computer he was devouring books on the topic of computer graphics and UI design.  Now he travels the world speaking at software conferences and teaching a diverse portfolio of programming topics for corporate clients. On the consulting side he continues to work with customers like Microsoft, HP, Intel, and Intuit and enjoys being part of the Wintellect consultant group.He has over fifty hours of video training courses available in the WintellectNow, Lynda and Udemy catalogs.  He writes for several publications including Code Magazine and has a new "HLSL and Pixel Shaders for XAML Developer" book available from O'Reilly Media. His current UI obsession revolves around the Windows 8 Metro, Mobile, ASP.NET MVC and WPF APIs.  This year he is learning as much as he can about Xamarin. You can find his blog at xamlwonderland.com. Walt is also a Microsoft MVP and author of the free Shazzam Shader Editor (shazzam-tool.com).</p>
<p>He is also deeply involved in the local developer community — founding the .NET Developers Association in Redmond, WA and continues to help organize the Seattle Code Camp, developer hackathons and other local events.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>Kate Gregory has been using C++ since before Microsoft had a C++ compiler, and has been paid to program since 1979. She loves C++ and believes that software should make our lives easier. That includes making the lives of developers easier!

<p>Kate runs a small consulting firm in rural Ontario and provides mentoring and management consultant services, as well as writing code every week. She has spoken all over the world, written over a dozen books, and helped thousands of developers to be better at what they do. Kate is a Microsoft Regional Director, and a Visual C++ MVP, an Imagine Cup judge and mentor, and an active contributor to StackOverflow and other StackExchange sites. She develops courses for Pluralsight, primarily on C++ and Visual Studio.

        <![CDATA[<p>Troy lives in the two worlds of building software and breaking software, predominantly software running on the web. From the very early days of HTML, Troy has been a web-centric guy all the way through to today’s modern devices either talking over HTTP or pushing angle brackets around. Having drifted towards security, he now focusses on helping developers understand how to break their own apps and build up offensive skills that are complemented by teaching secure coding patterns – if you don’t know how to break it, you don’t know how to protect it! Troy is an Aussie Microsoft MVP for Developer Security living in Sydney and writing at troyhunt.com as well as speaking around the world, training and creating Pluralsight courses.</p>
<p>When not building or breaking, Troy’s into snowboarding, lots of tennis and fast cars.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Lars Klint suffers from split personality, as some would say. On the one hand he is a passionate programmer using the Microsoft Stack through .Net and C#. On the other hand he is a mad car guy. Lars loves to get his hands dirty and maintain his fleet of classic and off-road cars. When he is not in front of a phone, laptop, desktop or other gadget, he is out in the bush getting muddy or on a car club cruise. Lars has so far published two courses with Pluralsight: Building Windows Phone Apps that Stand Out and Windows Phone Testing and Error Management. As a frequent blogger, Lars has contributed articles to the Kiandra IT Blog, Nokia’s DVLUP portal and his own blog at klint.co, often presenting arguments that are not quite main stream, but with a dash of humour and a smidgen of cheekiness. If you want to ask Lars questions, suggest blog ideas, sell a car etc., shoot him an email or follow@larsklint on twitter.</p>]]></description>
